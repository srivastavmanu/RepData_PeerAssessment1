Loading and preprocessing the data

## Part A : What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

### 1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

### 2. Plot a histogram of the total steps by day

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
## Read the file
setwd("D:/Personal/msworksOthers/201210_DocsAndResearchAndKnowledge/Coursera/data/repdata_data_activity")
ourdata <- read.csv("activity.csv") 
## Ignore the NA values
ourdata1 <-na.omit(ourdata)
##use dplyr to group the steps by date
by_date <- group_by(ourdata1,date)
## use dplyr to sum the steps per day
plot_by_date <-summarize(by_date, sum(steps))
names(plot_by_date)[2] <- c("SumSteps")

## Plot a histogram of the total steps by day
hist(plot_by_date$SumSteps, xlab = "Sum of Steps per day", main = "Total number of Steps Histogram")

## take a quick look at the summary
summary(plot_by_date)

## Find the mean of the Steps
mymean <- round(mean(plot_by_date$SumSteps))

## Find the medean of the Steps
mymedian <- round(median(plot_by_date$SumSteps))
```

### 3 . Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

### The Mean of the total Steps is `r as.character(mymean)`

### The Medean of the total Steps is `r as.character(mymedian)`


## End of Part A





## Part B : What is the average daily activity pattern??

### 1.Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

### 2.Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
## Read the file
setwd("D:/Personal/msworksOthers/201210_DocsAndResearchAndKnowledge/Coursera/data/repdata_data_activity")
ourdata <- read.csv("activity.csv") 
## Ignore the NA values
ourdata1 <-na.omit(ourdata)
##use dplyr to group the steps by interval
by_interval <- group_by(ourdata1,interval)
## use dplyr to mean the steps by interval

plot_by_interval <-summarize(by_interval, mean(steps))
names(plot_by_interval)[2] <- c("AvgSteps")

## TS plot of interval and mean steps during that interval of all days
plot.ts(plot_by_interval$interval/5, plot_by_interval$AvgSteps, type="l", xlab = "Interval of 5 mins", ylab = "Average Steps")

## take a quick look at the summary
summary(plot_by_interval)

## Find the max steps 
mymaxAvgSteps <- max(plot_by_interval$AvgSteps)

## arrange in desc order to get the interval
##head(arrange( plot_by_interval, desc(AvgSteps)))

## Divide the interval by 5 to get the which 5 min interval had the max average steps

```

### The max Avg Steps was 206.1698 and occured in interval 167

## End of Part B




## Part C : Imputing missing values

### 1.Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)

### 2.Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc
### 3.Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

### 4.Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
## Read the file
setwd("D:/Personal/msworksOthers/201210_DocsAndResearchAndKnowledge/Coursera/data/repdata_data_activity")
ourdata <- read.csv("activity.csv") 

## total number of rows with missing values in steps
length(which(is.na(ourdata$steps)))

totalNumberOfmissingRows <- length(which(is.na(ourdata$steps)))
ourdata1 <- ourdata
## filling the NA values in steps with  a value
## I could have used mean of the interval or mean of the day, but I preferred to used the mean of all the available steps for all the days to keep it simple and unbiased

ourdata1$steps[is.na(ourdata1$steps)] <- mean(ourdata1$steps, na.rm=TRUE)

##use dplyr to group the steps by date
by_date <- group_by(ourdata1,date)
## use dplyr to sum the steps per day
plot_by_date <-summarize(by_date, sum(steps))
names(plot_by_date)[2] <- c("SumSteps")

## Plot a histogram of the total steps by day
hist(plot_by_date$SumSteps, xlab = "Sum of Steps per day", main = "Total number of Steps Histogram")

## take a quick look at the summary
summary(plot_by_date)

## Find the mean of the Steps
mymean <- round(mean(plot_by_date$SumSteps))

## Find the medean of the Steps
mymedian <- round(median(plot_by_date$SumSteps))

```


### The Mean of the total Steps with NA values replaced is `r as.character(mymean)`

### The Medean of the total Steps with NA values replaced is `r as.character(mymedian)`

### As we can see the Mean and Median values dont defer with filling the NA values with a fixed values of the mean of the total steps.

## End of Part C




## Part D : Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

### 1.Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

### 2.Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.


```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
## Read the file
setwd("D:/Personal/msworksOthers/201210_DocsAndResearchAndKnowledge/Coursera/data/repdata_data_activity")
ourdata <- read.csv("activity.csv") 


ourdata1 <- ourdata
## filling the NA values in steps with  a value
## I could have used mean of the interval or mean of the day, but I preferred to used the mean of all the available steps for all the days to keep it simple and unbiased

ourdata1$steps[is.na(ourdata1$steps)] <- mean(ourdata1$steps, na.rm=TRUE)

## create another df so that we dont mess up the original dataframe
ourdata3 <-ourdata1
## Add another factor column for weekday or weekend
ourdata3$weekend <- factor(weekdays(as.Date(as.character(ourdata3$date),"%Y-%m-%d")) %in% c('Sunday','Saturday'))
levels(ourdata3$weekend)[levels(ourdata3$weekend)=="1"] <- "1"
levels(ourdata3$weekend)[levels(ourdata3$weekend)=="0"] <- "0"

##use dplyr to group the steps by interval and weekend
by_interval_weekend <- group_by(ourdata3,interval, weekend)

## use dplyr to average the steps per interval
plot_by_interval_weekend<-summarize(by_interval_weekend, mean(steps))
names(plot_by_interval_weekend)[3] <- c("MeanSteps")

## Plot a Mean Steps by Interval categorized by weekend
g <- ggplot(plot_by_interval_weekend, aes(interval, MeanSteps))
p <- g + geom_line()
print(p)
g + geom_line() + facet_grid(.~weekend) + labs(x = "Intervals") + labs(y = "MeanSteps") + labs ( title = "Mean Steps by Interval categorized by weekend")


```
